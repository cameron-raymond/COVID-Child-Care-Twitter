# Data Directory

The data directory stores the raw and processed CSVs scraped from Twitter. For more information on how the data is collected and processed see [`/notebooks`](../notebooks/README.md). All features, except for the `clean_text` column, are directly derived from the [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object#tweet-dictionary) provided by Twitter.

## Data Structure

*TODO:* Add table.
